Description of communication protocols : SQL engine on Local host.

Outline of the project : 
  Gobal warming is an issue which may affect our very existance if we do not holistically find a solution to. 
  Based on several city temperature data available and using key datasets available on Air Quality indicator, and populaiton growth, 
  this project intends to establish future temperature change predictions
  
  As a first step the project intends to establish a baseline of 6-10 cities data.
  Given the lack of time and resources, this was reduced to Los Angeles CA, because this was perfect with gathering 
  air quality data, which 


Intention of Project:
  Is key measures taken by city administration towards green initiative, is helping redcue global warming?
  Can we measure this from hand full of cities, home to large number of population with sufficient geographic variations such as
  1. Latitude/Longiture
  2. Hilly and Plains
  3. Mainland and Proximity to ocean.
  

Initial Analysis:
  Downloaded key data from foollwing reliable **Data Source**. 
    i.   Data & Data Products: Draft API Strategy | US EPA
    ii.  Air Data: Air Quality Data Collected at Outdoor Monitors Across the US | US EPA
    iii. Download Daily Data | US EPA
    Intention to integrate web APIs to update data over time is the final intent.
  
  Cleaned data using pandas and merged data with pandas and SQL.
  
  All visualizations were generated on plotly and mathplotlib.
  Correlation among data was initially establihed visually.
  
  All these plots/visualizations are shared in pages 6, 7 and 8 of Google document link above


For future development:
  In addition to adding more relevant data to existing data set in works, the final intent of this project initiaiton is to 
  add more cities and get a good co-relation of city temperature with Global average temperature variation. 
  As features going forward, ML model can be developed to learn the average Global temperature variation, 
  and to establish what portion cities contribute to in the overall average.

  It can also be understood, if rural areas can do the healing that cities may be contributing adversely because of large population sizes and energy consumption.

What was missed :
  It was understood that meat consumption, air comditioning and refregeration were significant contributers into Global warming and climate change.
    1. Explotation is on to find reliable dataset within cities on airconditioning, refregeration sale.
    2. Explotation is on to find reliable dataset in the amount of meat produciton mainly beef. This will be pertaining to rural area. 
       However, there should be good indicators of meat sales in cities to establish this trend.
